![Warning](screenshots/Warning.png)
+ If you use an add-on model and you will save game with no default model like Franklin or Michael or Trevor, your save gonna be broken and it can lead to crash or infinity loading.

+ Also when your add-on character is dying, the mod would replace current model to the model which that was during the launch of GTA V. This will save you endless loading.

+ And also, for some add-on models clothing components may be confused. For example gloves can be changed through the "Legs" menu. These are the features of the add-on models.
